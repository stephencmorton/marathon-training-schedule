## marathon-training-program

This provides a simple web-based tool for running groups to post marathon training programs to the web that auto-adjust to
fit your upcoming race dates.

The program also provides you a good indication of your training paces based on your goal race pace.

### TODO
- Fix up date routines and variables. 
- Remove _m variables or at least rename them _d as they're dates not moments.
- Allow modular drop-in of races
- Allow arbitrary race dates.
- Remove crazy race schedule code with filename to variable to filename
